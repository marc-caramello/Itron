# PartsToOrder

### The problem that needed to be solved
Earlene, the production supervisor, was responsible for completing orders for electric meters. Sometimes, she would suddenly run out of parts while completing the order. She wanted an easy way to know how many additional parts she needed to order or import to successfully complete the upcoming orders.

### The task that was assigned to me
My manager asked me to create a webpage that would do the following:
1. Show the upcoming orders as a bunch of checkboxes (1 checkbox per order)
2. Allow her to manually select specific orders using the checkboxes
3. Calculate the number of each part: needed to successfully build the upcoming orders, we currently have on-site, we currently have in the warehouse
4. Display the part in red if we need to order more from the supplier
5. Display the part in yellow if we need to import more from the warehouse
6. Display the part in green if we have enough on-site

### The result of my project
Every time Earlene needs to prepare for an upcoming order, she runs my program, and she easily knows: which parts to order, and which parts to import.
