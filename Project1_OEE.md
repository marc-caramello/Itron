### The problem that needed to be solved
The assembly line would often go down. The previous method to keep track of these downtimes was a clipboard & a piece of paper. This was ineffective for a variety of different reasons:\
•They kept losing the physical pieces of paper\
•It was impossible to do any data analysis with it

### The task that was assigned to me
My manager asked me to create a:\
1. Database system in SQL to keep track of the assembly line downtime\
2. Front-end webpage that prompt the assembly line worker to input the reason why the assembly line went down\
3. Back-end webpage that connected the front-end webpage with the database system

### The result of my project
•My project helped reduce assembly line downtime by 25%\
•Every time the line goes down, the managers know EXACTLY why it went down\
•The managers can now figure out the most common reasons for downtown and make specific changes to prevent them from happening again\
•My SQL tables helped another employee create a complex data analysis tool using PowerBI\
•Right now as we speak, my front-end webpage is open on multiple different assembly lines
