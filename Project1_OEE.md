## The problem that needed to be solved
The assembly line would often go down for a variety of different reasons. The previous method to keep track of these downtimes was a clipboard & a piece of paper. This was ineffective for a variety of different reasons<br/>
-They kept losing the physical pieces of paper<br/>
-It was impossible to do any data analysis with it

## The task that was assigned to me
My manager asked me to create a:<br/>
-Database system in SQL to keep track of the assembly line downtime<br/>
-Front-end webpage that prompt the assembly line worker to input the reason why the assembly line went down<br/>
-Back-end webpage that connected the front-end webpage with the database system

## The actions that I successfully completed
I created:<br/>
-Over 5 SQL tables, using: Microsoft SQL Server<br/>
-The front-end webpage, using: CSS, HTML, Javascript<br/>
-The back-end webpage, using: ASP.NET, Azure, C#, CSS, Git, HTML, Visual studio, Windows OS

## The result of my project
-My project helped reduce assembly line downtime by 25%<br/>
-Every time the line goes down, the managers know EXACTLY why it went down<br/>
-The managers can now figure out the most common reasons for downtown and make specific changes to prevent them from happening again<br/>
-My SQL tables helped another employee create a complex data analysis tool using PowerBI<br/>
-Right now as we speak, my front-end webpage is open on multiple different assembly lines
