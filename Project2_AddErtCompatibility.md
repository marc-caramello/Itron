### The problem that needed to be solved
Every time Debbie (the production scheduler) had to schedule production with an order that contained a new part, she would encounter this massive error. Then, she would have to call my mananger Kevin to manually fix the problem.

### The task that was assigned to me
My manager asked me to create a webpage that would do the following:
1. Ask Debbie to input the: Ert Order Number, Ert Line Number, and MSD
2. Run a SQL query that would retrieve the order information & files from the Itron location in Waseca, MN
3. Unencrypt the files
4. Write the retrieved information & unencrypted files into the local Itron database

### The result of my project
•If Debbie encounters the error from before, all she has to do is: input the information on my webpage, and click submit.\
•After she clicks submit, the error completely disappears, and it saves everyone a lot of time.
