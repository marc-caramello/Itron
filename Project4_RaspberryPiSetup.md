# RaspberryPiSetup

### The problem that needed to be solved
My manager wanted me to set up a few raspberry pis, which would display important information to the assembly line workers.

However, while I was doing this, I noticed a few different problems:
1. The guide that I was following (written in Microsoft word) was very confusing
2. The installation script was taking too long

3. Remove unnessary steps in the guide
4. Add missing steps to the guide
5. Speed up the installation script by removing uncessary code

### The result of my project
•Every time someone needs to set up a RaspberryPi, all they have to do is follow the steps written in my modified guide.\
•I successfully reduced the installation time by over 1 hour because I modified the script.
